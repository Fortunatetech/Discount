# Discount-Mart-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard

Discount mart is a small supermarket. The stakeholders wants a dashboard where they can track how well Discount Mart has been doing including this year 
(in terms of Sales, Profit and Quantity Sold). They also wanted to know how well categories are performing as well as different regions. 
They assumed that most customers buy 2 or more products per basket/order but would like this confirmed by the data. 
This project conveys these required informations.
